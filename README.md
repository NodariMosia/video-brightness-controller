# ![Video Brightness Controller Icon](public/icons/icon_32.png) Video Brightness Controller

Chrome extension to tune video brightness from 0% to 200%.
Useful for night-owls (like me) with annoyingly bright monitors even at 0 brightness level.

## Features

- Easily adjust video brightness on all sites;
- That's it, pretty simple.

## Install

COMING SOON TO CHROME WEBSTORE

<!-- [**Chrome** extension]() -->
