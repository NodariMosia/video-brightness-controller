# ![Media Brightness Controller Icon](public/icons/icon_32.png) Media Brightness Controller

Chrome extension to tune video or image brightness from 0% to 200%.
Useful for night-owls (like me) with annoyingly bright monitors even at the lowest brightness level.

## Features

- Control video or image brightness on current tab from extension popup (from 0% up to 200%).
- Control video and image brightness on current tab using following keyboard shortcuts:
  - Increase all brightness by 5% (up to maximum of 200%). Default shortcut: Alt+Shift+Up
  - Decrease all brightness by 5% (minimum of 0%). Default shortcut: Alt+Shift+Down
  - Reset all brightness to default (100%). Default shortcut: Alt+Shift+R

## Install

COMING SOON TO CHROME WEBSTORE
